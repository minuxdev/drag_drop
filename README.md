# drag_drop

Is a module to enable the drag-drop function in python-tkinter
I'm not the author of this module, so, for documentation and more, please, 
visit the official site [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.dnd.html#module-tkinter.dnd)!

## why is here? ##
The simplest answer is that it makes much easier for me to get the module working using a script that do the installation process automatically, although I might miss
some updates, however, for the application I'm currently building this one is working as expected.

## how do I install it ##
You you could install it manually, however, is much easier to let the script do it for you.
Note: The script is only working for linux, for windows and macOS will be added soon.
